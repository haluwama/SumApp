# SumApp
In this game the player can practice their math skills. For this project, I used an IDE called Intel Xdk. In order to easily adjust the code, I used design patterns called MVC and Singleton. It is based on Apache Cordova and thanks to this framework, it can be launched on many mobile platforms.

"This is a game, which at the moment has 4 modes. *Classic*, in which you choose many of the different numbers given and add them. In the *division mode*, you pick numbers divisible by the shown digit. *Power mode*, in which you raise the power of given numbers and *root extraction mode* where you choose the correct answer after calculating the root."
